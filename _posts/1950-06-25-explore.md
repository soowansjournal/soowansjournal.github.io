- 2024.01.12. **How do taxes work in Canada?**
   - Pay the marginal tax rate on each tax bracket you fill up. NOT the tax rate on the entire income. Federal Tax Rate AND Provincial Tax Rate.
- 2024.01.12. **How to avoid taxes legally?**
   - Investment. Side Business: Business Expense as Tax Deduction - income: 100k expense: 30k taxable income: 70k - we deducted 30k business expense from net income to reduce taxable income.
- 2024.01.13. **Why are interest rates higher for longer periods of loan?**
   - Quicker to pay back the loan is beneficial. 3% on 60 month term vs 5% on 84 months.
- 2024.01.13. **What is simple interest amortization loan?**
   - Monthly payments of PRINCIPLE + INTEREST where the monthly payment on principle slowly increases vs monthly payment on interest slowly decreases over the loan period. Total interest = remaining principle x annual interest rate x years. Example: Principle Loan = 100k, interest = 3%, 5 years. First total interest is 100k x 0.03 x 5 = 15k over 5 years so 15/60 = 250 interest for first month and agreed 1k off principle. Remaining balance = 98,750, interest = 3%, 5 years. Second total interest is 98,750 x 0.03 x 5 = 14,813 over 5 years so 14,813/60 = 247 interest for second month and agreed 1.1k off principle.
- 2024.01.13. **What is simple interest add-on loan?**
   - Precomputes principal and interest into one amount owed from the beginning, to be paid off in equal instalments. Higher cost, no benefit on paying early to reduce interest.
- 2024.01.13. **What is financing a car?**
   - I make a down payment of 20k and the bank gives me a loan of 80k for a 100k car. The car is used as collateral - if I default and can’t pay, the bank claims and sells the car. I pay the bank PRINCIPLE + INTEREST each month. Simple Interest Amortization OR Add-On.
- 2024.01.13. **What is mortgaging a house?**
   - I make a down payment of 20k and the bank gives me a loan of 80k for a 100k house. The house is used as collateral - if I default and can’t pay, the bank claims and sells the house. I pay the bank PRINCIPLE + INTEREST + TAX + INSURANCE each month. Simple Interest Amortization ONLY.
- 2024.01.13. **What happens if you default?**
   - Defaulting on a mortgage gives the bank the power to claim and sell your house through foreclosure or power of sale. Foreclosure you lose all ownership and don’t get any remaining balance if 80k debt is paid. Power of sale you might get some remaining balance if 80k debt is paid. Either way you lose your 20k down payment since it wasn’t borrowed from the bank.
- 2024.01.13. **What is leveraging?**
   - Bank lets you borrow for a 100k home if you can make a down payment 20k on your own. You bought the home at a leverage of 5:1 ratio 100k:20k. If the house appreciates to 150k over the year, you can make 50k from selling compared to a 30k studio.
- 2024.01.13. **How to invest in real estate?**
   - Equity and Cash Flow. Equity is the difference in the appreciated value of the house and the total mortgage you owe the bank - buy house low, sell high. Cash flow refers to renting the place out to tenants at a higher monthly payment than the monthly mortgage payment you owe the bank.
- 2024.01.13 **Is a house an asset or liability?**
   - Liability. There is no guarantee that the house will appreciate in the years given. You will be making a down payment and monthly mortgage payments that involve principle, interest, tax and insurance. There will be maintenance costs. You’re paying the opportunity cost from the magnitude of cash flow that can be used NOW to invest in better returns such as the stock market.
